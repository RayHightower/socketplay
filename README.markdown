Experimenting with WebSocket support (via Action Cable) in Rails 5. This app will keep track of single board computers and their capabilities.

What would it be like to run a Rails app w/WebSocket support on [Parallella](/blog/2015/08/22/madison-ruby-and-parallella/)?

* The two ARM cores run the Rails app.
* Tasks that can benefit from parallelism run on the 16-core epiphany chip.


Application Details:

* Ruby version: 2.3.0
* Rails 5.0.0.beta1
